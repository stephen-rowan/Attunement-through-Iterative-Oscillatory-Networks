feat: implement AION educational simulation with real-time visualizations

Implement complete AION (Attunement through Iterative Oscillatory Networks) 
educational simulation as specified in specs/001-aion-simulation.

## Core Implementation

### Models & Simulation Logic
- Implement Oscillator class with phase and intrinsic frequency management
- Implement SimulationState with Kuramoto equation dynamics
- Implement SimulationParameters and SimulationControlState dataclasses
- Add NumPy vectorization for efficient O(N²) all-to-all coupling calculations
- Implement phase wrapping and resonance index calculation (R = |(1/N) Σ e^(iθ_j)|)

### Visualizations
- Unit circle plot showing oscillator positions on unit circle
- Resonance index chart tracking synchronization over time
- Real-time updates with Plotly interactive charts
- VisualizationData dataclass for managing plot data

### User Interface
- Streamlit-based web application with sidebar controls
- Parameter controls (N, K, Δt, animation speed, frequency range)
- Simulation controls (pause, resume, reset)
- Educational content explaining key concepts (oscillator, phase, resonance, attunement)
- Auto-start behavior with smooth real-time updates

### Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for oscillator, simulation, and Kuramoto equation
- Integration tests for simulation flow, parameter changes, and edge cases
- Edge case validation covering all documented scenarios (K=0, N=1, high K, etc.)
- 66 tests total, all passing

## Documentation

### Educational Content
- Detailed explanations of phase coupling and meaning emergence
- Comparison with reinforcement learning and diffusion models
- Discussion of AI applications and RAG workflow potential

### README
- Complete setup instructions and usage guide
- Expected behavior documentation (convergence and clustering)
- Technical details on Kuramoto equation and resonance index
- Tips for observation and parameter tuning

## Technical Details

- Python 3.11+ with Streamlit, Plotly, NumPy
- Performance optimizations: batch updates, history limiting, vectorized operations
- Error handling and validation throughout
- Smooth visualization updates with reduced flickering
- Comprehensive edge case handling

## Files Changed

- 51 files changed, 7345 insertions

- All 52 implementation tasks completed
- Full test coverage of core models (91-100%)

This implementation provides a working educational demonstration of the AION model,
showing how oscillators converge and cluster through phase coupling, representing
the emergence of meaning through collective interactions.
