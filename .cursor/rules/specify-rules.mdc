## Active Technologies
- Python 3.11+ (Streamlit requires 3.8+, 3.11+ recommended per constitution) + Streamlit (web framework), Plotly (visualization), NumPy (numerical computations) (001-aion-simulation)
- N/A (in-memory simulation state, no persistence required) (001-aion-simulation)

- Python 3.11+ (Streamlit requires Python 3.8+, 3.11+ recommended for performance) + Streamlit (web framework), Plotly (visualization - see research.md for rationale), NumPy (numerical computations) (001-aion-simulation)
